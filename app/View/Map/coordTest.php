 	INFORMATION FOR FUTURE SOAP TEAMS:
	This file contains a sample of code that could potentially run the PointAnalysis c++ executable file which analyzes the 
	coordinates with the clusters formed by the clustering algorithm.  It has not yet been implemented in SOAP but should
	in the future be called from SOAP/app/webroot/js/map.js file and passed the latitude and longitude.
 -->
 

<?php
	// Runs the PointAnalysis executable file to find the cluster info of the point
	// Takes the latitude and longitude strings as input parameters and returns the cluster information.
	function runPointAnalysis($lat, $long){
		exec("SOAP/app/View/Results/src/PointAnalysis $lat $long" , $clusterInfo);
		return $clusterInfo;
	}
?>
