This file was made in the Fall 2014 Semester of CSC 415 (Software Engineering) for the Blogging in the Deep Group 
The files in this ckeditor folder are all used for ckeditor to render onto the app/View/Blogs/add page 


You can edit plugins for ckeditor here.

All of these files were added but only the config.js was edited to remove the ability to resize and to add YouTube
functionality.
