# SOAP

# This project adds a module to SOAP (Students Organizing Against Pollution) worked on by TCNJ students in CSC 415.

Our module will add a News Page to the Blogs page including an RSS feed reader, featured articles, and a way for journalists to 
submit articles to the reader to be displayed. 


You can view our page here: http://csc415-team02.tcnj.edu/cabect/SOAP/index.php/blogs

We edited the index.ctp and view.ctp of Blogs, BlogsController, removed Post Model and Post Controller(because of issues with our page) and worked with Blogs Model.
